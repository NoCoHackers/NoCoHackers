What makes AI software different? Why now? And what can we do with it for free? We'll pinpoint WHY Neural Nets, The Attention Transformer and Nvidia GPUs combine to make apps that can mimic Human creativity. We'll highlight why "Attention" makes From-Anything-Into-Anything processing possible for unquantifiable skills like Language Creativity, Photo-realistic Art production, Detailed Security Scanning and Medical Diagnostics to name a few. We'll also touch on the broader opportunities and concerns for AI in 2024. I will post a second unpresented slide deck with personal-use Open Source AI apps that people can use at home today. We can talk about specific apps and/or AI use cases if the audience has some shared interests.
